# Little Modern Man

This is an unfinished project to simulate and visualise the LMC fetch-decode-execute cycle. It was started at the end of 2015, and is probably extremely poorly written. Sorry.  

It was intended to be a better-looking version of the [Peter Higginson's LMC simulator](http://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc/), which is used as part of the A Level/ GCSE Computer Science course. 

The code is available to use and modify as you wish (and maybe even get it working ðŸ™€). However, the `FileSaver.js` and `sweetalert-dev.js` files are available to use under the MIT license (and not by me). 

I'm not sure that the demo process is actually correct either.
